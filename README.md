HTML5DevConf (Oct 2014)
=======================

The slides and demos from my HTML5DevConf talk: [How Web Components Will Change CSS Best Practices](http://html5devconf.com/speakers/philip_walton.html#session).

## Slides

To install the dependencies and view the slides, run the following commands:

```sh
# Install the dependencies.
npm install

# Start up a local server on port 3000.
npm start
```

You can now navigate in your browser to [localhost:3000](http:/localhost:3000) and view the slides.

If you'd like to run the server on a different port, change the last command above to the following:

```sh
# Change "1234" to the port number of your choosing.
npm start -p 1234
```

## Demos

Once you have the server running, you can view the demos by navigating to [localhost:3000/demos](http://localhost:3000/demos).
