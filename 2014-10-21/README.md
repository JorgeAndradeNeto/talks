How Web Components will change CSS best practices
=================================================

The slides and demos from my [HTML5DevConf talk](http://html5devconf.com/speakers/philip_walton.html#session) on Oct. 21, 2014.

## Slides

To install the dependencies and view the slides, run the following commands:

```sh
# Install the dependencies.
npm install

# Start up a local server on port 3000.
npm start
```

You can now navigate in your browser to [localhost:3000/2014-10-21](http://localhost:3000/2014-10-21) and view the slides.

If you'd like to run the server on a different port, change the last command above to the following:

```sh
# Change "1234" to the port number of your choosing.
npm start -p 1234
```

## Demos

Once you have the server running, you can view the demos by navigating to [localhost:3000/2014-10-21/demos](http://localhost:3000/2014-10-21/demos).
